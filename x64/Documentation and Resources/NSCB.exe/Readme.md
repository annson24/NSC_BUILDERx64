# NSCB.exe
## 1. What's NSCB.exe?
Is a .net console app that opens NSCB.bat inside itself when it's in the same folder. It supports *Drag and Drop* for auto mode and allows to hook NSCB to the windows bar or the start section in windows 10.
First version doesn't support configurations though a second one will at least allow redirection via a config file.

## 2. Changing console properties
When you first open NSCB.exe it'll use the cmd console presets from windows which are a little ugly so here I'll tell you how to change it. Also take note that this will happen with every new copy of NSCB.exe, applying to the windows bar or the start section on windows 10. Once you change the properties on one executable they'll be kept and you won't need to change them again.

First click over the program's icon in the window and go to properties, this is a normal console but you get the idea.

Then in layout I recommend the following parameters:

**- Width:** 95

**- Height:** 41

Lastly in font I recommend the following:

**- Size:** 16

**- Font:** Consolas

**- Bold:** Click over "Bold fonts"

**And then the console should look like it does in my first picture.**
